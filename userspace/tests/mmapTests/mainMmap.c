/** tests ideas:
 *  TODO: for MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS:
 *      - test giving mmap & munmap invalid parameters (for munmap, length cant be 0, start must be multiple of page size, start must be in the range of mmaped memory)
 *      - test mapping then write, should be possible, then unmap then write again, should be error
 *      - similar to the test above, but 1 threads calls munmap and another thread tries to read afterwards
 *      - test unmaping twice on same address
 *      - test mapping 2 pages then unmap both pages at once using 1 munmap call, this should be possible
 *      - test mapping 1 page but then unmap 2 pages, should be error
 *      - test mapping 2 pages but then unmap 1 pages twice, should be possible
 *      - test mapping on unmapped page.
 *      - changes to the file shall not be visible for other processes (MAP_PRIVATE).
 *      - map private a page, then call fork. each process should now has its own version of the page. (cow)
 * 
 *      
 *      for MAP_PRIVATE:
 *      - wrong params
 *      - check writing back to file successfully with and without munmap
 *      - open file that has 5 pages, mmap with offset 1 page, reading data from page 2 3 4 5 should be correct. Also try reading page 5 first then 2 then 4 then 3
 *      - write to mem, unmap, check if the data still written to the file. Also try this with process termination instead of unmap
 *      - mmap then fork, both process should have their own version of the page privately
 *      
 *     for general:
 *      - mmap with wrong params
 *      - mmap with multiple pages
 *      - give a bullshit fd value
 *     - test different protection flags
 *      - test different flags
 * 
 *      - set readonly prot then write to it
 *      - writting/reading after munmap
 *

/**
 * This test the "lost wake call", which is when a thread is holding a lock, about to go to sleep so another thread
 * can take that lock and wake first thread up
 * Optimal is thread1 release the lock and go to sleep, thread2 take the lock and wake up thread1
 * problem is when thread1 release the lock, thread 2 take the lock and wake up nobody then exist, then
 * thread 1 go to sleep and never get the wake call
 * 
 * NOTE: To test this, we have to introduce a small delay in thread1 between releasing the lock and going to sleep
 * Go to pthread_cond_wait() in pthread.c and add this code
 * 
//   pthread_mutex_unlock(mutex);      // dont actually add this line, just for reference

//   printf("2. thread1 must wait, so it release the lock and about to sleep\n");
//   for (size_t i = 0; i < 900000000; i++)
//   {
    
//   }
//   __syscall(sc_sched_yield, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0);
//   printf("4. thread1 finally going to sleep now\n");
  
//   *(size_t*) new_waiter_request_to_sleep = 1;        // dont actually add this line, just for reference

    NOTE: since this modify the pthread.c, we should test this cond6 alone.
    NOTE: this test works correctly, if the order of the steps is correct, and theres a delay between step 3 and 4

    WARNING: dont forget to remove the code after testing
